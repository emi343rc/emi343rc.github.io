        <h3>Narrative</h3>
        <p>
            Working on this enhancement has been a rewarding experience. Revisiting my old project with the knowledge I’ve gained from more advanced courses gave me a completely new perspective. Although I’ve forgotten some of the finer details of C# syntax, I now have a much stronger understanding of object-oriented programming — including concepts like classes, objects, and structured design. It’s fascinating to see how much my approach to coding has evolved since I first created this artifact.
        <p>
            Initially, my plan was to enhance all three games included in the original application. However, as I began implementing improvements, I realized that it wasn’t feasible to refine every game within the time available. Because of this, I decided to focus my efforts on improving the Flappy Bird game, ensuring that it was as polished and functional as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            This enhancement process wasn’t without challenges. The first major hurdle I faced was configuring my GitHub repository so that I could work seamlessly between my home PC and my school laptop. I ran into several errors and synchronization issues at first, but eventually managed to find an effective workflow.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second challenge came when I restructured the Flappy Bird game into multiple classes. Once I changed the timer interval from 100ms to 16ms to achieve smoother performance, I had to rewrite large portions of the logic. Many integer values became floating-point calculations, and I needed to rework the physics behind the gameplay. Despite the obstacles, this process taught me a great deal about modular programming and the impact of design choices on system performance.
