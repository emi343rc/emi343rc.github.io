        <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the development of this ePortfolio, I’ve had the opportunity to look back at how much I’ve grown both technically and professionally. Revisiting my original artifact and improving it week by week has allowed me to apply new knowledge from multiple areas of computer science from software design principles to data structures and database integration.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I first created the original project, my focus was mainly on getting it to work. Now, I approach software with a more structured and analytical mindset. I’ve learned to think in terms of scalability, reusability, and maintainability principles that guide good software design. During the first enhancement, for example, I realized how much cleaner and more flexible my code became after refactoring it into separate classes and improving its object-oriented structure. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the second enhancement, I applied algorithmic thinking to introduce game difficulty management, using logical structures and data organization to make the game more dynamic and engaging. This not only strengthened my understanding of data handling but also helped me see how logic and user experience intersect in game development.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third enhancement, focused on database integration, was one of the most rewarding parts of this process. Implementing MongoDB Atlas taught me how powerful and practical modern cloud-based solutions can be. I learned to manage user data securely, store individual progress, and think beyond local storage bringing a sense of real-world application to my project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this ePortfolio reflects my growth as a developer who can not only write code but also understand why and how to improve it. I’ve learned to identify challenges, plan enhancements, and deliver meaningful updates skills that are directly applicable in professional software development. Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come and confident that the habits I’ve built through this process persistence, problem-solving, and adaptability will continue to guide my growth in future projects.
