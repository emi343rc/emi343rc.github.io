        <h1>Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data structures </h1>
        <p>
            This enhancement focused on expanding the game’s logic by introducing a difficulty system that allows players to choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes. The goal was to make gameplay more dynamic and rewarding by requiring players to unlock Hard mode after reaching a certain score. This addition not only improved user engagement but also demonstrated a stronger use of algorithms and object-oriented programming principles to manage game states efficiently.

            For testing purposes I changed the value required to unlock the 'Hard' difficulty to 1, but the official value is 50+

    <section class="second-narrative">
        <h2>Narrative</h2>
        <p>For this enhancement, which focused on the Algorithms and Data Structures area, my goal was to expand the game’s logic by implementing a difficulty selection system—introducing “Easy,” “Medium,” and “Hard” modes. I wanted the player to have access to Easy and Medium difficulties from the start, but to unlock the Hard mode only after meeting a specific requirement: scoring over 50 points on Medium difficulty. Once unlocked, the Hard mode would increase various parameters such as object speed, size, and gap spacing to create a more challenging experience.</p>
        <p>Initially, my plan was quite simple but not efficient—I considered duplicating the existing game form, renaming them to “EasyFlappy,” “HardFlappy,” and so on, and modifying each one individually. However, after reflecting on the scalability and maintainability of this approach, I decided to pursue a more robust, object-oriented solution. I introduced several new classes, including Difficulty.cs, DifficultySettings.cs, UnlockManager.cs, and GameProgress.cs, to manage the game logic dynamically. These handled aspects such as difficulty configuration, unlock conditions, and progression tracking.</p>
        <p>I then moved on to building the DifficultySelector form, which would serve as the player’s interface for selecting a difficulty. While I enjoyed refining the UI, I encountered multiple setbacks. Some buttons were misaligned, unresponsive, or overlapped, and at one point, I accidentally deleted what I thought was an unused event handler—breaking the entire project in the process. The handler itself wasn’t functional, but its reference still existed in the form’s designer file, and removing that single line took me hours to identify and fix.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, implementing this system was extremely rewarding. I spent additional time ensuring that the lock/unlock logic for the Hard difficulty worked seamlessly, and I left this enhancement with a much deeper understanding of how algorithmic structures and object-oriented programming principles can work together to create scalable and dynamic game systems.</p>
